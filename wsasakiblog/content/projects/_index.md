***Released July 26th, 2023***

Skill-based action brawler for PICO-8

*Having gotten used to PICO-8, I wanted to make something thrilling, as I hadn't seen many action games for the platform. I was craving a PICO-8 game with twitchy combat, high difficulty, and satisfying game-feel with visual polish.*

*It proved difficult to stay within code token limits, and the shape of the project morphed and shifted constantly throughout development. Despite this, I'm proud of the final build, which now provides the jumping-off point from PICO-8 to Unity development.*

***Released May 1st, 2023***

Minesweeper for PICO-8

*I developed Mini Mines to become more confident in PICO-8 and Lua. The code is something of a mess, but it taught me invaluable lessons about creating user interfaces and enjoyable controls within the restrictions of the console.*
