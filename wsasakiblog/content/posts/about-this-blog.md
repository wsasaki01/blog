Hi! I'm Will, and I'm learning to make games.

This blog will feature my development experience across projects, including design, programming, and releasing builds to the public.

The past few months, I've learned how to use [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) (a fantasy game console), and Lua, releasing two games for the console.

I'm currently learning how to use Unity while redesigning one of my PICO-8 games, [Icebreaker](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=53552).

I'm a beginner when it comes to C#, Unity and game design in general, so I want this blog to be a collection of the skills I learn and a record of my progress as I get to grips with game dev.

Posts might be sparse, but I'll update the blog whenever I have the time!

Follow on socials to keep up with this blog and my game projects!
